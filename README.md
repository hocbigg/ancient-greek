# Summary

The Ancient Greek curriculum is a complete education in Ancient Greek using online materials (focusing on Attic Greek of the Classical period, with extensions to Homeric and Koine).

The program emphasizes progressive language acquisition, literary reading, historical/cultural context, and analytical skills. Logical sequencing builds from fundamentals to advanced textual engagement.

The resource page can be found here: [ancient-greek/resources](resources.md).

## Organization

This repository is organized into 2 main components:

- **Core Curriculum** (this page): the foundational knowledge of the field;
- **[Advanced Topics](advanced_topics.md)**: focused study in specific areas;

**Process:** Learners may work through the curriculum independently or collaboratively, and either sequentially or selectively.

- For simplicity, courses in the Core Curriculum are ordered according to their prerequisites.
- The Core Curriculum provides a shared foundation and is intended to be completed in full.
- Advanced Topics are optional; learners are encouraged to select one area of focus and complete all courses within that topic.

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md).

1. Foundations of Ancient Greek (Attic)  
   Start here. This section teaches you how to read and understand basic to intermediate Attic Greek (the standard dialect of classical Athens). Without these grammar and reading skills, the rest of the roadmap will be very difficult.

2. Attic Prose Mastery  
   Immediately after Foundations. This section builds your ability to read real, unadapted classical Greek prose confidently and introduces more advanced sentence structures.

3. Historical & Cultural Context  
   Study this while or right after working through Attic Prose. It gives you the historical and literary background that makes the texts you are reading meaningful.

4. Philosophy  
   Tackle this next. Plato and Aristotle wrote in clear, influential Attic prose. By this point you will have the language skills to read them in the original with growing confidence, and their works are central to understanding classical Greek thought.
