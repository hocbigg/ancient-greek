# Summary

The Ancient Greek curriculum is a **complete education in Ancient Greek** using online materials (focusing on Attic Greek of the Classical period, with extensions to Homeric and Koine).

The program emphasizes progressive language acquisition, literary reading, historical/cultural context, and analytical skills. Logical sequencing builds from fundamentals to advanced textual engagement.

**The resource page** can be found here: [ancient-greek/resources](resources.md).

Note: When there are courses or books that don't fit into the curriculum but are otherwise of high quality,
they belong in [extras/courses](extras/courses.md), [extras/readings](extras/readings.md) or [extras/other_curricula](extras/other_curricula.md).

## How to Use This Learning Roadmap

### Core

Everyone should complete these four sections in sequence. They form the essential foundation you need before moving into more advanced or specialized material.

1. **I. Foundations of Ancient Greek (Attic)**  
   Start here. This section teaches you how to read and understand basic to intermediate Attic Greek (the standard dialect of classical Athens). Without these grammar and reading skills, the rest of the roadmap will be very difficult.

2. **II. Attic Prose Mastery**  
   Immediately after Foundations. This section builds your ability to read real, unadapted classical Greek prose confidently and introduces more advanced sentence structures.

3. **III. Historical & Cultural Context**  
   Study this while or right after working through Attic Prose. It gives you the historical and literary background that makes the texts you are reading meaningful.

4. **VII. Philosophy**  
   Tackle this next. Plato and Aristotle wrote in clear, influential Attic prose. By this point you will have the language skills to read them in the original with growing confidence, and their works are central to understanding classical Greek thought.

Completing these four sections in order will give you a coherent, well-rounded foundation equivalent to the core of an undergraduate major in Ancient Greek or Classics.

### Specialization Tracks (Choose After the Core)

Once you have finished the Core sections, you can choose one or more of the remaining sections depending on your interests. These are deeper dives and are not required for a general understanding, but they allow you to explore particular directions in the field.

The specialization tracks are:

- **IV. Homeric Greek**  
  Focus: epic poetry (Iliad and Odyssey), older dialect, and poetic meter.

- **V. Greek Drama**  
  Focus: tragedy and comedy, theatrical performance, and the chorus.

- **VI. Lyric & Hellenistic Poetry**  
  Focus: shorter lyric poems (Sappho, Pindar) and later Hellenistic poetry.

- **VIII. Historiography**  
  Focus: historical writing (Herodotus and Thucydides).

- **IX. Koine & Post-Classical Greek**  
  Focus: the simplified Greek of the Hellenistic and Roman periods, including the New Testament and other later prose.
